For this project, I will use the xv6 ﬁle system image as the basic image that you will be reading and checking. The ﬁle
 include/fs.h includes the basic structures you need to understand, including the superblock, on disk inode format ( struct dinode ), and directory entry format ( struct dirent ). The tool tools/mkfs.c will also be useful to look at, in order to see how an empty ﬁle-system image is created.
 Much of this project will be puzzling out the exact on-disk format xv6 uses for its simple ﬁle system, and then writing checks to see if various parts of that structure are consistent. Thus, reading through mkfs.c and the ﬁle system code itself will help you understand how xv6 uses the bits in the image to record persistent information.
 Your checker should read through the ﬁle system image and determine the consistency of a number of things, including the following. When a problem is detected, print the error message (shown below), followed by \n to standard error and exit immediately with exit code 1 (i.e., call exit(1) ).
