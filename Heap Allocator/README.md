 * This structure serves as the header for each allocated and free block.
 * It also serves as the footer for each free block but only containing size.
 * Function for allocating 'size' bytes of heap memory.
 * Argument size: requested size for the payload
 * Returns address of allocated block on success.
 * Returns NULL on failure.
 * This function should:
 * - Check size - Return NULL if not positive or if larger than heap space.
 * - Determine block size rounding up to a multiple of 8 and possibly adding padding as a result.
 * - Use NEXT-FIT PLACEMENT POLICY to chose a free block
 * - Use SPLITTING to divide the chosen free block into two if it is too large.
 * - Update header(s) and footer as needed.
 * Tips: Be careful with pointer arithmetic and scale factors.
